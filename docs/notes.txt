	MySQL database
	Client: javascript+jQuery (bootstrap for style)


	Tables:
	Activity -> id, name, description, current_happening, start_date, end_date, output/outcomes, school (many), departments (many),
	Community partner -> id, name, address, contact name, contact email (it can be multiple)
	Population-> id, name (mandatory)

	Department->id, (are they optional?)
	Course->code, name
	Location -> id, name, optional address(?)

	Served people neighbourhood


	Questions:
	1. What is the limit for schools, departments, courses and contact information  (i.e., 2 schools per each activity)?
	2. What is "unit notes"? (I think unit is refering to department)
	4. What is the difference between Location and "Neighborhood of who is served"?
	5. Is contact information associated with the whole activity, or with a community partner?
	6. Is it needed to create a separate table for contact, or the contact is an arbitrary information depending on each activity?
	7. About the queries you sent us, is the place equals to location in the excel file?
